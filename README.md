# sharepriceanalysis
A simple python app to analysis shares on the ASX for a SMA formula.

One problem that I am facing is that the program is excuting in the memory and then is returning an error that it cannot complete the task. Coming up with a plan on how I can implement a database so that it can execute this program and chart multiple stocks at a time.
